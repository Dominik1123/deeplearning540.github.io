Lesson 04: Classification with Clustering
*****************************************

Learning Objectives
===================

* Use clustering for classification.

* introduce accuracy, precision and recall as quality metrics

* explain how a cut-off value can be used to (for kmeans classification) can be used to produce a ROC curve

* show `plot_roc_curve` in sklearn


Content

This content doesn't exist yet. Clustering can be used for classification. This would pick up the knowledge from previous lesson and focus on classification accuracy and ROC curves.

Exercises
=========

* cluster the `penguin dataset <https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins>`_ into 3 classes when looking at bill length vs flipper length; the data is available `here <https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/tree/master/inst/extdata>`_

* `sklearn based datasets <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets.html>`_:

  * https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#iris-plants-dataset into 3 classes when looking at petal_length vs. petal_width
