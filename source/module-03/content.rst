Lesson 03: Clustering
*********************

Learning Objectives
===================

* Clustering is a form of unsupervised learning

* Unsupervised learning algorithms donâ€™t need training

* Kmeans is a popular clustering algorithm.

* Kmeans struggles where one cluster exists within another, such as concentric circles.

* Spectral clustering is another technique which can overcome some of the limitations of Kmeans.

* Spectral clustering is much slower than Kmeans.

* As well as providing machine learning algorithms scikit learn also has functions to make example data



Content

This lesson is based on `Regression <https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/machine-learning-novice-sklearn/04-clustering/index.html>`_ and will be shared as a video.

* nice quick notebook available `on kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/khotijahs1/k-means-clustering-of-iris-dataset>`_ that may be used as support

Exercises
=========

* cluster the `penguin dataset <https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins>`_ into 3 classes when looking at bill length vs flipper length; the data is available `here <https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/tree/master/inst/extdata>`_

* `sklearn based datasets <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets.html>`_:

  * https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#iris-plants-dataset into 3 classes when looking at petal_length vs. petal_width

  * https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_wine.html#sklearn.datasets.load_wine not sure yet which features to use
