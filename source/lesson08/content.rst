Lesson 08: Deep Learning is ML too
**********************************

Learning Objectives
===================

- define precision and recall/accuracy for a classification task
- state that cross-validation is used in Deep Learning too
- describe how to split a data set into training/test/validation set
- describe how to split a data set into training/test/validation set
- describe how Drop-Out Layers work
- execute a plot to draw the loss per epoch for training and test set
- compare values of precision and recall
- differentiate a overfitting network from a well-behaved network
- detect when a network is underfitting or overfitting
- design countermeasures for overfitting (e.g. more dropout layers, reduce model size)
- design countermeasures for underfitting (e.g. larger model)
- critique a provided network design
