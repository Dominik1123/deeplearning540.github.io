Please refer to https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation for the
installation of `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org>`_.
You can verify your installation using below command:

Build steps
^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Clone the repository to some folder of your choice on your local system and
   change your current directory into the root of the project.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/psteinb/deeplearning540.git
    $ cd ./deeplearning540

2. The project's dependencies are managed with `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org>`_.
   To build the project locally run below lines of code in your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ poetry install
    $ poetry run make html

If all dependencies are properly installed you only are required to execute
the last command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ poetry run make html

    $ # Alternative way
    $ poetry shell # This enables the environment for the current session
    $ make html
